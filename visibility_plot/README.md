# Visibility plot

## 📖 Overview

This Jupyter notebook visualises astronomical visibility for a specific object based on your location and observation time. Simply enter your latitude, longitude, elevation, and date, and the tool will generate detailed plots and timing information to help you plan your observations.

### 🔍 Features

- Times of rising, culmination, and setting for the selected object.
- Phases of twilight (civil, nautical, astronomical) and their durations throughout the year.
- Object altitude at local midnight, tracked daily.
- Separation angles between the object and both the Moon and the Sun.
- The object’s and Moon's sky path for the chosen night.
- Hours during which the object is above a specified altitude, during both astronomical night and twilight.



## 🔭 Planned Features

Future updates will bring enhanced functionality and interactivity:

- 📌 Support for multiple objects plotted simultaneously and coordinate-based input (RA/Dec) instead of just named objects.
- 🧭 Interactive plots for more precise altitude/timing exploration.
- 🌌 A full sky chart at midnight for any date, showing stars and planets.
- 🌙 Moon altitude added to annual visibility plots.
- ⏰ Automatic detection of the best observation time based on altitude and sky brightness.
- ∞ Analemma plot for a given location (Sun’s position at the same time each day).
