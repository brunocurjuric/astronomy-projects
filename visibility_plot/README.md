## Visibility plot

#### Info
This notebook displays visibility information for a specific object. Enter your latitude, longitude, height, and observation time to view when the object rises, culminates, and sets. It also includes information on the settings and rising times of different twilights throughout the day, as well as their duration over the course of the year. For each day, the altitude of the object at the middle of the night is shown.

Additionally, the separation between the object and the Moon and Sun is displayed, along with the object's movement across the sky on that night.

Finally, the hours the object is above a specified altitude are shown for both astronomical night and the period when the Sun starts to set below the horizon (civil twilight).


#### Future
Future updates will include multiple objects on the visibility plot. Many plots will be interactive to allow precise times and altitudes to be obtained. They will also feature a sky plot to illustrate how the night sky looks at midnight on a given date with all the stars and planets.
