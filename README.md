[`constellations_quiz`](./constellations_quiz) is an interactive quiz app designed to test your knowledge of stars and their corresponding constellations. Customize your experience by selecting the difficulty level—based primarily on stellar magnitude—and choosing a specific region of the sky to focus on.

There are different modes available:

- **Single Player**: Learn and test at your own pace.  
- **Multiplayer**: Challenge friends and compete in this hot seat mode.  
- **Arcade Mode**: See how far you can go by progressing through increasing difficulties.

Whether you're an astronomy enthusiast or just starting out, these quizzes offer an engaging way to explore the night sky.

[`stars_quiz`](./stars_quiz) is similar to [`constellations_quiz`](./constellations_quiz), but with a stronger focus on learning about individual stars. It helps users become familiar with the constellations stars belong to, their Bayer designations and apparent magnitudes.

Unlike [`constellations_quiz`](./constellations_quiz), this version is not competitive — it does not include highscores or game modes, making it more suitable for study and self-paced learning.

[`sky_plot`](./sky_plot) is a visual tool that simulates the appearance of the night sky on any given date. It includes a slider to simulate different levels of light pollution, helping to approximate what you'd see from urban to rural areas.

In addition to the star field, it also displays:

- Planet rise and set times  
- Night duration  
- Phases of twilight (civil, nautical, astronomical)

Useful for stargazers, educators, and anyone interested in understanding how light pollution and time affect sky objects and visibility.

[`visibility_plot`](./visibility_plot) displays the visibility of a celestial object over the course of a specific night from a given location. It includes:

- Airmass and Moon separation  
- Object altitude throughout the night  
- Duration of twilight phases and full darkness throughout the year 
- Annual visibility: hours above a specified altitude for each day of the year

The object's movement across the sky is visualized to help plan observations and identify optimal viewing times
