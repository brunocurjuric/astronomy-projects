## Sky Plot

#### Info
This notebook shows how sky looks like on a given date and location (latitude and longitude). Location and date can be given by deafult, or can be obtained by input. If you want to input either location or date, just comment the row where variable is declared or write yours.
Stars are taken from SIMBAD database where stars up to 6.5 visual magnitude are given (limiting magnitude for human eyes).


#### Future
Future updates will include ecliptic line, constellation lines, slider for changing limiting magntiude to simulate urban areas, as well as rotating sky feature. It will also feature when the night begins on a given date.
