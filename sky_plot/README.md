## Sky Plot

#### Info
This notebook shows how sky looks like on a given date and location (latitude and longitude) together with the ecliptic line - pathway of the sun. Location and date can be given by deafult, or can be obtained by input. If you want to input either location or date, just comment the row where variable is declared or write yours. Slider can be used to simulate urban areas (with the increment of 0.5).
Stars are taken from SIMBAD database where stars up to 6th visual magnitude are given.


#### Future
Future updates will include ecliptic line toggle on/off, constellation lines, as well as rotating sky feature. It will also feature when the night begins on a given date. Moreover, database will expand to stars up to 6.5 visual magnitude (limiting magnitude for human eyes).
