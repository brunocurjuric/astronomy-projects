## Messier marathon

### Description

`messier_marathon.py` calculates how many Messier objects are visible from a given location on a specific date. Currently, only *astronomical nights* are considered—periods when the Sun is more than 18° below the horizon. It also includes Moon illumination data to help assess the quality of observing conditions.


This script uses Astropy and astroplan packages, which can be installed via:
```console
pip install astropy astroplan
```

You can run the script directly from the command line:

```bash
python messier_marathon.py
```

---


`messier_quiz.py` is a command-line quiz designed to help you strengthen your knowledge of the Messier catalogue.  
The current version provides two practice modes:  
- Guess the constellation from a Messier object number
- Guess the Messier object from its common name  
- Guess the constellation from a Messier object common name

You can choose how many objects you want to practice with, and the script will randomly select that number from the dataset.


To run the script, make sure you have the required dependencies installed.  
Then simply run the following command in your terminal:
```
python messier_quiz.py
```
You will likely need to install openpyxl for reading the Excel file:
```
pip install openpyxl
```


### Roadmap

Planned features for upcoming releases:

- 🌐 **Equatorial Coordinate Map**  
A sky chart showing all Messier objects with RA/Dec grid overlays.

- 🌃 **Night Sky Visualisation**  
  Dynamic sky plots indicating which Messier objects are visible throughout the night.

- 📅 **Annual Visibility Chart**  
  A graph displaying the number of visible Messier objects per night across the year, including corresponding Moon illumination.

- 🔍 **Optimal Date Finder**  
  Automatically selects the best night for a Messier marathon based on object visibility and Moon phase for a given time interval.

- 🗂️ **Observation Strategy Guide**  
  Step-by-step observing order to maximise found objects within the night (early evening → dawn progression).

- 🧠 **Interactive Quiz Mode**  
  A learning module with:
    - Guess the object based on its Messier number
    - Guess the object’s type from its Messier number
    - Identify the object based on its position in the sky
    - Identify the object from an image (only for nebulae and galaxies)

- ⚙️ **Command-line Interface Enhancements**  
  Easily set observation parameters using CLI flags (e.g. `--lat`, `--lon`, `--date`, `--quiz-mode`).

- 🌗 **Custom Night Start Definition**  
  Option to choose when visibility begins—civil, nautical, astronomical twilight, or full night—based on observer preference.
